# Puffer | A Personal Inflation Index

Inflation is measured by tracking the average change in prices paid by consumers over a period of time for a basket of goods and services. That's great for macroeconomic purposes, but what it doesn't mean much for the average consumer.

Puffer is a tool to track your own set basket of goods over time you can track inflation as it pertains to you. Use this tool to find out that the cost of enjoying ice cream has gone up, so you can dial it back or reduce spending in categories that you choose!
